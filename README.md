# Musician Testing Exercise

This exercise is meant to help get some practice with writing tests in mocha and chai.

The repo has two test suites, `song-test.js` and `artist-test.js`, with their
`it` blocks filled out. Your job is to *write the tests and implementation for these suites*, getting everything to pass.

## Steps for installation:


1. Clone down the repo
2. `cd` into musician-exercise
3. Run `npm install`
4. Write tests for `song-test.js` first
5. Run `npm test song-test.js` to run the test
6. Get `song.js` implementation working
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for `artist-test.js` and `artist.js`
